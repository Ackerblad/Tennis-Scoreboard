# Tennis-Scoreboard
This project was developed as a coding challenge where I was tasked with creating a tennis scoreboard.

Challenge:

Tennis has a rather quirky scoring system, and to newcomers it can be a little difficult to keep track of. The tennis society has contracted you to build a scoreboard to display the current score during tennis games.
1. A game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two 
points more than the opponent. 
2. The running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis: scores from zero to 
three points are described as "Love", "Fifteen", "Thirty", and "Forty" respectively.
3. If at least three points have been scored by each player, and the scores are equal, the score is 
"Deuce".
4. If at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has one more point than his 
opponent, the score of the game is "Advantage" for the player in the lead.
